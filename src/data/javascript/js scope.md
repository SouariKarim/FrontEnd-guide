are declared inside a function and becaume local at the function. local variables have function scope : they can only be accessed from within the function .

**global variables** :
the variables are declared outside the function. a global variable has a global scope, that means that all scripts and functions on a web page can access it .

**the scope** determines the accessibility (visibility) of variables , objects and functions from different parts of the code .
