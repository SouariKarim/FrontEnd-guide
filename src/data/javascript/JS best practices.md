## Javascript best practices :

1. A variable declared without a value will have the value of undefined .
1. if you add a number and a string the result will be a string
1. you can empty an object by setting it to Null
1. the difference between undefined and Null is that they are equal in value but different in type ( undefined and object ).
1. use backslash \ escape character turn special caracter into string caracter

```javascript
\'   \"   \\
```
